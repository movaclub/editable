# EDit

## Objectives

This is a workout to brush up Angular 8 usage, in which there are in-place editing, SPA state management with rxjs subject and some other group ops on a fake data set of 100 records.

All green text bits, i.e. _cursor_, _per page_ and _company_ are editable upon double click.

The application retains an edited value on _Enter_ click until reflresh or another launching: the fake data set is loaded from local JSON file.

The table columns aren't toggleable, but are sortable.

## Developer's notes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
